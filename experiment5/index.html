				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>In this programming assignment, we're building a generator that directly reads inspiring images, renders parameterized images, and adjusts its own designs to optimize an evaluation score. In this case I partnered with Grace Herman, another student and we each challenged eachother to a specific implementation after brainstorming together. The challenge I got was to create an image generator based off of Conway's Game of Life and Noise generation.</p>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>This project integrates inspiring images taken from my camera role, that are selectable from the drop-down on the display page.</li>
                    <li>The design object is initialized in inspiration-specific ways. Selecting different inspirations changes the image size and therefore how many cells are created in the simulation.</li>
                    <li>The design is rendered by a combination of Conway's Game of Life and adding Noise dependent on the Mutation Slider.</li>
                    <li>Also, the rate at which the backgrounds disipates is also dependant on the slider as well as the accuracy of the colors of the cells.</li>
                </ol>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Annealing</h2>
                <p>While I tried to finetune the way that the Mutation Slider interacts with the simulation to create an "annealing" effect, I still think there was some room for improvement. Annealing the slider does sometimes work, but because of the randomness inherent to the Game of Life the simulation is based off of sometimes it doesn't. To try and improve upon this I tried to finetune the values as I said, but unfortunately after finetuning them for a while, still the best strategy is too set the noise to fill the whole screen with cellular auto-mata and then quickly slide it to 0 to get the long lasting after image with many "alive" cells in the simulation still around.
                </p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This experiment was really cool and glad I was able to accomplish what I think is something true to the initial challenge.</p>
