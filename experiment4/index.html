				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>An infinitely scrolling stone retaining wall generated from the world key. (Use "A" or "D" or "left arrow" or "right arrow" to move the view) 
				   Credit for snail artwork goes to: Grace Herman.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>The rock wall is generated 1 column of rocks at a time and continues to generate more as you move the camera to the right. The rocks themselves start out as quads which then get 4 extra points in between each edge with random offsets to create a more jagged rocky look. The snails continue to generate to the right of the camera while the program runs and have a random walk determined by the world key.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I'm happy with how I was able to get the rocks generating randomly and laying nicely next to each other. I wish I had more time to figure out how to get the rocks infinitely generating in all 2D dimensions, but I'm really happy with how they look even though they only go to the right. I feel like I was able to capture the essence of the reference image I used. (Shown above).</p>
